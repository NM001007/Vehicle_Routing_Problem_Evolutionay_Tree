# Vehicle_Routing_Problem_Evolutionay_Tree

This an implementation of the paper proposed by Niu et al. in 2021, entitled "An improved learnable evolution model for solving multi-objective vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand".

Briefly speaking, the paper uses evolution algorithm along with decision tree classifier to solve the vehicle routing problem in which the clients have stochastic demands. Moreover, several objectives have been considered in this algorithm including the distance, total time spent, and the number of sub-routes which is also referred to as the number of vehicles.

The implemented algorithm is then tested on Solomon dataset and the results are reported.
